# 🛠️ System Health Reporter (`system-report`)

*Sends you a beautiful, detailed HTML email report every morning showing your Server RAM, CPU usage, Disk Space, running services, and database health so you don't have to log into the terminal to check.*

## 🚀 1. How to Install (The Easy Way)
Instead of copying files manually, use our automated installer which handles permissions and `cron` jobs automatically:
```bash
cd /root/hestiacp-useful-tools/scripts/system-report
bash install.sh
```

## 📂 2. File Paths (Where is everything?)
If you want to look at the files, here is exactly where the installer places them:
* **The Executable Script:** `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-system-report`
* **The Configuration File:** `/etc/hestiacp-system-report.conf`

## ⚙️ 3. How to Configure
By default, the script will check EVERYTHING (CPU, RAM, MySQL, Exim, PHP). If you want to disable checking a specific component:

1. Open `/etc/hestiacp-system-report.conf` in your editor (`nano /etc/hestiacp-system-report.conf`).
2. Turn off the variable you want. For example, to stop checking MySQL errors, change `CHECK_MYSQL="TRUE"` to `CHECK_MYSQL="FALSE"`.
3. Save the file.
4. The system reporter automatically reads this file the next time it runs its morning cron job.

## ⛔ 4. Crucial Rules (What NOT to do)
* **DO NOT** edit the `.sh` executable file directly. Your changes will be wiped on the next update! Always edit the `.conf` file in `/etc/`.
* **DO NOT** change the permissions of the executable. It must remain `755` (rwxr-xr-x) and owned by `root:root` to function correctly inside Hestia.
* **DO NOT** run this script manually as a normal user. It must be executed as `root` to read system-level metrics.

## 🔬 Advanced Architecture Notes (Geeks Only)

### Core Checks Performed
*   **Performance Metrics:** CPU Load Averages, RAM Consumption (Actual Use vs Cache), Disk Partitions.
*   **Hestia Services:** Validates operational state of `nginx`, `apache2`, `bind9`, `exim4`, `dovecot`, `mariadb`, etc.
*   **PHP-FPM:** Scans all pools for crashes or 503 errors.
*   **Databases:** Tracks MySQL slow query logs and crash errors in `syslog`.
*   **Network:** Queries email IP blacklisting databases to ensure your IP reputation is solid.
*   **Certificates:** Audits SSL Expiry dates for all domains.

### Security & Hardening Improvements
- Replaced fragile `pidof -x` script concurrency checking with robust atomic `flock` filesystem locks.
- PHP version detection in error log analysis is now fully dynamic (auto-adapts to PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.5+, etc.) without needing hardcoded paths.
- Bound by `set -o pipefail` and `trap ERR` to email crashes.
- Removed duplicate `run_with_timeout()` functions to optimize memory footprint.
